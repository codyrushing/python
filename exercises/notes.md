## REPL
* just like JS.  Useful built-in methods:

* `type(var)` - tells you what type `var` is.  Think `typeof`.
* `dir(var)` - tells you all of the methods that are available on `var`.  Sort of like printing an object's prototype.
* `help(type)` - eg `help(str)` prints some help info on methods on class `str`

Gotchas:

* variables can't start with an e
* python lets you overwrite built in types.  eg: `list = 'abc'`.  This overrites `list`, which is a built in method for making lists, So don't do that
